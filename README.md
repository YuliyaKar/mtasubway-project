# Let's take a ride?.. 
## Analysis of New York MTA Subway data

This project is based on the data containing the information about New York subway riderships: date, station name, number of entries/exits etc. This data can be paired with historical weather data from Weather Underground in order to relate the number of ridership to weather conditions. How correlated are those data and can we use weather forecast to predict the popularity public transport?

The project is inspired by Udacity Data Science course, and contains several exercise scripts (visualization.py, mapreduce.py etc.) I also use the data to implement different techniques that I learn from other sources.
